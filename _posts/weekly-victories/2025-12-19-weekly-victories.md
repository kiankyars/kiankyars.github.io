Victory #2:

- Presented ARC at the Cohere Monthly Lightning Talks.

Victory #3:

- Switched things up this week in the spirit of not doing the same thing that's not working and expecting a different result.
- I went to the library near my house from Monday to Wednesday and then the one by my mom's work on Thursday, and although it wasn't ideal, it was better than being alone at home. After a trough on Wednesday, the week recovered fast for an amazing Friday and end of the week.

Bonus 1:

- Talked with my mom about my current struggles.

Bonus 2:

- Reconnected with a lot of people.

Bonus 3:

- 
wasted to much time exploring
