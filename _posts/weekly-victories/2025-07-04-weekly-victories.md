Victory #0:

- Superlative sauna session on tuesday evening with Elliot, Daryna, and Rohan.

Victory #1:

- Grokked python packaging in two days, I'm a pypi wizard now.

Victory #2:

- Submitted the THIRD revision of my article to the [Columbia Math Journal](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/cjum/index), I have been exploited and will never submit to an undergraduate journal again (good thing I can't anyway since I'm done school), but at least I'll have a fire journal publication come August 😈.
- Took all of wednesday to do, not counting the days of stress from the previous revisions in March and April.

Victory #3:

- 10pm Bunker rave on wednesday was lit, instant dopamine after submitting the journal from #3.
