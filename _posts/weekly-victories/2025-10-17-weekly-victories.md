Victory #1:

- Greatful for Thanksgiving with family and friends.

Victory #2:

- Waking up early now consistently.

Victory #3:

- This week was 100% a flop. I started off the weekend extremely well, having re-implemented all of my habits, but after Thanksgiving I completely flopped. From Monday to essentially Thursday apart from sporadic moments of productivity, I was mostly just reading, which I'm happy about, but also on Tuesday I spent way too much time on YouTube. So I just need to be better.
