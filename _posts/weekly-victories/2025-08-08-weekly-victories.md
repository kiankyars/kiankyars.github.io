Victory #1:

- Did a long bike ride on Saturday from 9-5 and ate wild redcurrants (probably > 300), blueberries, raspberries, and strawberries!
- Passed by a music festival on my way back and got the blessing of my life when I found a stand giving out free Celsius energy drinks which was clutch given my dehydration.

Victory #2:

- Did a [hackathon](https://x.com/neuralkian/status/1952050363252818082) from Saturday to Sunday and only slept 2 hoursâ€”that was STUPID!
- I always regret not sleeping, even though in the moment I thought it was a good idea.

Victory #3:

- Did a 30 km run on Tuesday, felt a mild runner's high, and found a beautiful lake, that was great!

Bonus 1:

- Participated in a Finnish sitsit on Friday night, will remember that!
