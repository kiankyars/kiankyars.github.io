Victory #2:

- Co-worked from the Commons in Hayes Valley during the super bowl, wasn't that nice of a place tbh, this was honestly a pretty good signal that I should start to taper down exploration in favour of exploitation.

Victory #3:

- Was at Mox on Monday, could not focus, but I at least setup the regex parallel claude agent.

Victory #4:

- Co-worked from sf parc on Tuesday, great group of ambitious people there and got loads of work done! 

Victory #5:

- Wednesday was an insane climax day, but also can't really say climax since it's only uphill from here.

Victory #6:

- Received many heart-warming comments about my Open Claw video.
