Victory #2:

- Co-worked from the Commons in Hayes Valley during the super bowl, wasn't that nice of a place tbh, this was honestly a pretty good signal that I should start to taper down exploration in favour of exploitation.

Victory #3:

- Was at Mox on Monday, could not focus and the 90/30 club was mid, but I at least setup the regex parallel claude agent.

Victory #4:

- Co-worked from sf parc on Tuesday, great group of ambitious people there and got loads of work done!

Victory #5:

- Wednesday was an insane climax day, but also can't really say climax since it's only uphill from here.
  - parallel agent expirements went nuts.
  - Met with Bob from Antler.
  - Attended SPC F&F day, great discussion with Bilal and attended the embodied AI group.
  - Locked into RLMs and [presented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UFJVc2IkyFY&t=2s) my work on parallel agents.
  - Came up with a great idea while lying in bed from 10 pm to 1 am.

Victory #6:

- Received many heart-warming comments about my Open Claw video, 200k+ views now!
