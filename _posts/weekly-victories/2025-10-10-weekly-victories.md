Victory #1:

- Restarted timelapses on X.
- It's crazy that's been more than a month that I've been back in Canada and I feel like I've been way too slow getting back into it but it is true that I was in Ottawa for two weeks at the start and went on a one week bike trip two weeks ago and then another two day trip after that. So it's definitely been unideal in terms of focus and consistency, but I have nothing that will kick me out of my routine going forward, so I'm ready to truly lock in.

Victory #2:

- Productive meeting with mom's accountant
- There's still so much to learn, of course. Tax optimization in the corporate world is insanely complex, but I think it's kind of cool too.

Victory #3:

- Reunited with my boy Ian at stairs.

Victory #4:

- Monday and Tuesday were both wasted days, Monday was worse, just wasted time on Youtube.
