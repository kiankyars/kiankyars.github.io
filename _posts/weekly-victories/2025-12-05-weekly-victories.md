Victory #1:

- Massive recovery from last week and we're back on the grind. Let's fucking go.

Victory #2:

- I volunteered for six hours in total with grade five students. On Monday I did three hours and on Tuesday I did another three hours, and both were incredible and without a doubt the reason for my success. I had lost touch with volunteering and interacting with people the last while and week especially, but now that I've restarted that, things are going really well.

Victory #3:

- Did an interview on Monday morning for a TA position in a deep learning upskill course happening in London. My interviewer told me I did well and I just explained the transformer to him, I find out the result next Monday.

Bonus 1:

- Went on a few walks with my good friend Elliot and they were really enjoyable.
