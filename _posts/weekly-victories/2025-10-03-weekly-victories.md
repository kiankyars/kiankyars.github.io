Victory #1:

- Returned from the legendary bike trip on Sunday, experience can be compressed and I sure did, so many memories made in so little time, that trip was true iron-will building.

Victory #2:

- Invitied and went to Drumheller for one night the next Tuesday by Andreas and Jerick, who also drove me back to Edmonton. It really warmed mt heart that they invitied me back, had a fun trip and I ate a horse at the hotel continental breakfast as per usual.

Victory #3:

- Restarted daily walks with my uncle, will continue until he leaves at the end of the month!

Bonus 1:

- Ich bin zum Stammtisch meiner Universität gegangen für das erstes mal und hat mein deutsch gut benutzt, es war schön obwhol es dort wenig zu essen gab (es gab nur Pommes).

Bonus 2:

- Finished editing all of the videos from my cycling trip!
