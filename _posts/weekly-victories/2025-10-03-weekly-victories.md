Victory #1:

- Returned from the legendary bike trip on Sunday, experience can be compressed and I sure did, so many memories made in so little time, that trip was true iron-will building.

Victory #2:

- Invited and went to Drumheller for one night on Tuesday with Andreas and Jerick, who also drove me back to Edmonton. It really warmed my heart that they invited me back, had a fun trip and I ate a horse at the hotel continental breakfast as per usual.

Victory #3:

- Restarted daily walks with my uncle, will continue until he leaves at the end of the month!

Bonus 1:

- Ich bin zum Stammtisch meiner Universität für das erstes mal gegangen und hat mein deutsch gut benutzt, es war schön obwhol es dort wenig zu essen gab (es gab nur Pommes).

Bonus 2:

- Finished editing all of the videos from my cycling trip!
