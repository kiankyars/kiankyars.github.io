Victory #1:

- I made it to Finland on June 5th and I am now living here like a boss with a routine established and daily runs.

Victory #2:

- I switched projects due to uncertainty, but then after a productive conversation with Nantte, switched back to FLE because the path I chose wouldn't be the best in the world, locked in now on making the world's best benchmark.

Victory #3:

- Pacemaker for 5k race for the first time with Henri for 20 minute 5k: do hard things.
