Victory #1:

- Like a Phoenix, I came out from the ashes and had an amazing week, went through the principles of deep work by Cal Newport and [removed all the bullshit](https://remnote.com/a/Deep-Work/690dd8c4e1836eeb5cd3894e) and applied this for the past five days with amazing success.

Victory #2:

- Started planning my days consistently in advance, and that shit is a game changer.

Victory #3:

- Made a Wikipedia account, and contributed to various pages, which was fun.

Victory #4:

- Decluttered a lot of bookmarks and was scared by Safari twice thinking that it had deleted my tabs, but I clutched them back both times, and I also decluttered my room.

Victory #5:

- Played Battlefield 3 on my Xbox 360 on Sunday as a reward for clutching the Safari tabs, but it honestly is a shit game.
