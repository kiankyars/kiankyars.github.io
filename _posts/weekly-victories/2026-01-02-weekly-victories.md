I'm also going to do a daily summary because why not?

On December 27th, we were supposed to go to our relative's house for a birthday dinner, but they unfortunately became sick, so it was cancelled, and I instead locked in for the entire day on micro peepee and didn't eat until 7 p.m. in the evening, because I wanted to finish it before eating. I had some nice oatmeal and banana peanut butter bagel for dinner and got a lot of the series done. In fact, the first 80% was finished that day.

On the following Sunday the 28th, I continued grinding on the series and I was home alone because my mom was on call and my sister was in Camrose. But it was still a great period of productivity. The fact remained though that I didn't finish G pipe or 1F1B due to the technical complexity. But I can't complain and then I went to the rink with Elliot in the evening and we talked about startup ideas, I told myself once I came back that I would finish the series but I was just too tired and you can't record content when you're tired. I also learned some key computer engineering concepts this day, such as race conditions and deadlock.

On the 29th, I had a late start to the day because of skating late the day before. And early in the day I decided that I would go get the tattoo, which I did, and I also dropped off a hardware drive for repair and went to the library, but it wasn't productive to be honest. So this day was kind of a scratch and I was just not feeling well because of the fact that I wanted to finish the series by then but I hadn't. I also went to my old workplace though, which was pretty cool after a few years not seeing it. I left my mouse at the library, but luckily I got it back on the next day, which was the 30th.

This was yet another scratch day. I just wasn't able to work on what I wanted to and didn't plan my day, which is the most important thing that I realize—what determines one's success is whether or not you've planned the day or not. But at least my friends came over in the evening and that was pretty fun. And I got my mouse back and I got to hang out with my friend Vince as well. But I stayed up pretty late that day just cleaning up after they left and I ate too much so the next day also didn't start as early as it should have. They should really be starting at four a.m.

On New Year's Eve it was cool because I went on a nice run with my two friends Ethan and Cade and took the bus home since my hands were freezing and then after that I went to skate and then ate too much food since I hadn't eaten prior to that point. Tried to do micro PP, but just as I was getting into the flow state I had to go to Elliot's and then spent the night there.

On New Year's Day I spent the time with my mom although I was tired because I was up until 1 that day, but we made lasagna and pizza which was nice (I did eat too much though yet again). I read some of my book, which was a good change after little reading over the past month, but otherwise I took a nap for two hours in the middle of the day, which took out most of the time that I had that day, so it wasn't the New Year's that I wanted.

On the 2nd, I just did busy work on my computer the entire day, which was unfortunate. And then we went to our relative's house that we were supposed to go on the 27th for the evening, which was nice.

Definitely a mediocre week and luckily this new year is gonna be insane, so it's gonna be only uphill from here.
