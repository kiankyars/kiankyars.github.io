- Feels (still feeling it) 10x worse after compared to the 50 k, and I only did half!

Victory #2:

- Very satisfying and fulfilling work on [FLE](https://jackhopkins.github.io/factorio-learning-environment/), especially on Thursday (demon mode learning openai dota 2 paper and code monkeying).

Victory #3:

- Attempt to go viral by launching [twtr](https://github.com/kiankyars/twtr), ngmi.

Victory #4:

- Spoke with [Lukas](https://lukaspetersson.com), great insights.

Victory #5:

- I think I went to the sauna every day this week, ngl doesn't seem to help me fall asleep but is amazing nonetheless.
