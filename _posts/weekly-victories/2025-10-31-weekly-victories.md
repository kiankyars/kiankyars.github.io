Victory #0:

- Our solar panels went live on Tuesday!

Victory #1:

- Still incredibly inconsistent with respect to my habits, it's either one hundred percent on or one hundred percent off.
- The key that I have determined is that if I start my day early at my desk, it will be a good day. If not, it won't.
- This week was even worse than 10-17 Tbh.

Victory #2:

- C'est l'Halloween!
