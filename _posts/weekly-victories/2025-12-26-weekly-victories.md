Victory #9:

- Shabe Yalda with Anahita first and then Maryam, we laughed and ate a lot (I ate too much).

Victory #10:

- Even though I eat pancakes every weekend courtesy of my mother, they were especially tasty this weekend.

Victory #11:

- Monday was hell (didn't sleep Sunday-Monday), but my resilience is so strong that I was back to 100% Tuesday.

L #1:

- I just now remember as well that the most annoying thing this week was that I wasted two hours trying to recover some Safari tabs that I lost on my phone on the 24th. So I know what not to do in the future, which is to keep my tabs open until I've addressed them by either capturing it or deleting it knowingly.
