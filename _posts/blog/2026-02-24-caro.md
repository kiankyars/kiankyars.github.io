Only read 87 of ~2400 pages in the first few days of 2026, but I didn't enjoy it so stopped reading.

I picked up the series because of Dwarkesh's general praising of the author and the books.

"this book just shows so far how much of an arrogant power demon this guy was and for that reason I'm inclined to say I will not be finishing it.

It's also incredibly worrisome that he was the single reason for the Vietnam more effort being scaled by an order of magnitude and also making the presidential role more authoritative"
