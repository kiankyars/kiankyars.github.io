Only read 87 of ~2400 pages in the first few days of 2026, but I didn't enjoy it so stopped reading.

I picked up the series because of Dwarkesh's general praising of the author and the books.

This book demonstrates how much of an arrogant power demon LBJ was.

It's also incredibly worrisome that he was the single reason for the Vietnam war effort being scaled by an order of magnitude and also making the presidential role more authoritative, according to the author.

The one takeaway from this book is that to achieve success on the order of LBJ, the "do everything and you will win" mindset is helpful.
