I received my [MarketSenseAI](https://marketsense-ai.com/blog/ai-automation-and-digital-infrastructure-cycle-2025-12-16?utm_source=email) newsletter last month, and saw that Micron, WD, and Sandisk are up 200% and 300% YTD respectively, wow!

ASML targets are as high as 1200 euros, and MU targets are $330!

What's the best intrument?

Buying stock and holding is low agency. You need leverage, but if margin is too dangerous for you, then choose LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities).

- Beyond the financial loss the option has literally been preoccuping me since Friday
- I shouldn't have invested in short-term options (greed took over)
