Hello, world. In my quest to dominate the blogging world, it has become apparent that substack offers more leverage than hosting a blog on my personal website. Therefore, I am posting there from now on. Please visit my substack [here](https://substack.com/@kiankyars).

I intend on posting on hacker news as well LessWrong to get more reach to become the Matt Levine for AI.
