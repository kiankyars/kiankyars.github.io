Inspired by [Nicholas Carlini's C compiler agent team experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler).

## TL;DR

I tasked two Opus 4.6 agents to build a regex engine, then walked away. Here is the [repo](https://github.com/kiankyars/regex).

Over 14 Claude Code sessions, the agent team wrote ~1700 lines of code, and now I have a working Rust regex engine:

```bash
kian@Kian regex %   cargo run -- "a+b*" "xxaaabbbzz"
   Compiling regex-engine v0.1.0 (/Users/kian/Developer/regex)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.06s
     Running `target/debug/regex-engine 'a+b*' xxaaabbbzz`
MATCH:aaabbb
```

## Setup

This experiment required three separate pieces:

1. A remote which the agents could push to and build their work

2. A server for running the agents on the cloned remote (the original experiment uses Docker containers; I do not)

3. A third directory (which is my main contribution) called [regex](https://github.com/kiankyars/parallel-ralph/tree/main/regex) that with the harnessing not provided by the original post, namely:

- AGENT_PROMPT.md
- launch_agents.sh
- agent_loop.sh

## Workflow

I ran two agents in parallel with a loop script.

Each agent loop does:

1. Clone the repo into `workspace-<agent_id>` if not already.
2. `git pull --rebase origin main`.
3. Run Claude on yolo mode with the [shared prompt](https://github.com/kiankyars/parallel-ralph/blob/main/regex/AGENT_PROMPT.md).
4. Append session output to per-agent log files.
5. Sleep briefly and repeat.

Coordination primitives in the repo:

- `current_tasks/` for lock files (task claiming)
- `notes/` for handoffs and caveats
- `PROGRESS.md` for shared status updates

## Analysis

### Where the real work happened

The implementation progress came from a small number of successful sessions:

- bootstrap to 37/38 tests
- harness fix and edge tests to 54/54
- optimization and robustness to 69/69
- hardening and expanded coverage to 159/159

### Session count is not commit count

- some sessions produced lock-only commits
- some sessions produced multiple commits
- some sessions produced no commit

### Coordination

- The lock-file mechanism using `current_tasks/` was generally effective, but there were a few cases where [stale](https://github.com/kiankyars/regex/commit/f2a3da76bd10fde16744a39c3ed95eb06ab88c51) locks required cleanup.

### Two things that helped

- using oracle-based testing against the Python `re` library
- preserving modular boundaries (parser → abstract syntax tree → compiler → virtual machine)

## Replication

If you would like to replicate these results, it suffices to:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kiankyars/parallel-ralph.git
mv parallel-ralph/regex .
# rm -rf parallel-ralph
chmod 700 regex/*.sh
./regex/launch_agents.sh 2
```

The above assumes you have the Claude Code CLI installed on your machine, along with `screen` and a few other standard Linux packages.

## Future Work

Today I am building SQLite from scratch, but this time I'm going to use both Codex and Claude on the same project to see how heterogeneous agents interact with each other. I considered using a lock TTL (time to live) and automatic stale-lock cleanup to prevent agents from being blocked by abandoned lock files.

### Multi-agent

I'm thinking of having specialized agent roles as well. Here is what Carlini did:

> I tasked one agent with coalescing any duplicate code it found. I put another in charge of improving the performance of the compiler itself, and a third I made responsible for outputting efficient compiled code. I asked another agent to critique the design of the project from the perspective of a Rust developer, and make structural changes to the project to improve the overall code quality, and another to work on documentation.

## Appendix

### Code size

- Counted files: 6 (`.rs` + `.sh`)
- Total lines: 1,680
- Approx. code lines (non-blank, non-comment): 1,331
- Rust: 1,328 total / 1,091 code lines
- Shell: 352 total / 240 code lines

### Agent sessions

- Total logged sessions: 1,273
- Agent 1 sessions: 519
- Agent 2 sessions: 754
- Rate-limit-only sessions: 1,259
- Non-rate-limited sessions: 14

### Usage

- Tokens: In 9.4k / Out 6.5k (I realize now that this is completely erroneous, but this is what Claude Code said the token usage was. Their token tracker is not working.)
- Used ~30% of my Claude Pro weekly limit

### Notes on the Anthropic approach

- For context, this is the initial [commit](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/commit/d8cbbec87e0607e6c6aedd601b1ea9afba3c4e7b) on the Anthropic repo, and this is the first [page](https://github.com/anthropics/claudes-c-compiler/commits/main/?after=6f1b99acb2f4ec2414592136c2009fe7713deec3+3960) of commits.
