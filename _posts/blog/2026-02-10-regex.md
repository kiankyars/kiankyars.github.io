title: Building a Regex Engine with a team of parallel Claudes

Inspired by [Nicholas Carlini's C compiler agent team experiment](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/building-c-compiler).

## TLDR:

I tasked two Opus 4.6 agents to build a regex engine, and then walked away, here is the [repo](https://github.com/kiankyars/regex).

Over 14 Claude Code sessions, the agent team wrote ~1700 lines of code, and now I have a working rust regex engine:

```bash
kian@Kian regex %   cargo run -- "a+b*" "xxaaabbbzz"
   Compiling regex-engine v0.1.0 (/Users/kian/Developer/regex)
    Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.06s
     Running `target/debug/regex-engine 'a+b*' xxaaabbbzz`
MATCH:aaabbb
```

## Setup

This expirement required three seperate pieces:

1. A remote which the agents could push to and build their work

2. A server for running the agents with a cloned remote (the original expirement uses docker containers, I do not)

3. A third directory called [server-stuff](https://github.com/kiankyars/regex/tree/main/server-stuff) which hosts the files note provided by the original author, namely:

- AGENT_PROMPT.md
- launch_agents.sh
- agent_loop.sh

My main contribution is providing the above harnessing.

## Workflow

I ran two agents in parallel with `screen` and a simple loop script.

1. Keep `regex/` and `server-stuff/` as sibling directories.
2. Set `REPO` in `agent_loop.sh` to the local regex path.
3. Set `PROMPT_PATH` in `agent_loop.sh` to `server-stuff/AGENT_PROMPT.md`.
4. Launch with:

```bash
./server-stuff/launch_agents.sh 2
```

Each agent loop does:

1. Clone the repo into `workspace-<agent_id>` next to `regex/`.
2. `git pull --rebase origin main`.
3. Run Claude with the shared prompt.
4. Append session output to per-agent log files.
5. Sleep briefly and repeat forever.

Coordination primitives in the repo:

- `current_tasks/` for lock files (task claiming)
- `notes/` for handoffs and caveats
- `PROGRESS.md` for shared status updates

## Replication

If you would like to replicate these results, it suffices to:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kiankyars/regex.git
mv regex/server-stuff .
chmod 700 server-stuff/launch_agents.sh server-stuff/agent_loop.sh
git checkout -f c592a0534e60db71795863a8e64598f3779afc86
./server-stuff/launch_agents.sh 2
```

The above assumes you have a claude code cli client installed on your machine along with screen and a few other standard linux packages.

## Future Work

Today I am building sqlite from scratch, but this time I'm going to be using both Codex and Claude on the same project to see how heterogeneous agents interact with each other.
