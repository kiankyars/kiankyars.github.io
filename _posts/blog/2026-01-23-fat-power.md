It seems many powerful people are not healthy, I wanted to verify whether this was true and compare it to the general population.

According to a 2015 study published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) by Oberndorfer et al., Presidents and Prime Ministers often live 4.4 fewer years than the runners-up they defeated.

The above study only looked at 17 countries.

The Whitehall Studies revealed that civil servants in the lowest employment grades had mortality rates three times higher than top-tier administrators.

Therefore, it seems that the phenomenon is true for the top 1% of leaders (head of state/government), but otherwise, power is positively correlated with health.
