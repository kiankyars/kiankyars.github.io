Here's the story of the beginning of how I avoided a mediocre life. I say beginning and not just that I'm no longer mediocre at all because I'm only starting this journey and I'm not cocky enough neither convicted to say that a life worth living is simply the result of a choice or some event. It is a sustained effort throughout one's entire life.

Throughout my entire life I've had aspirations and dreams of being somebody exceptional. I believe that every human that grows up in a loving environment and does not have ordinary constraints also possesses this mindset and is curious. This reminds me in fact of a thought exercise that the wise Nantte led us through at FR8, telling us to close our eyes and think about a time in our youth when we believed anything is possible and that there are no limits, and then subsequently saying us that this infernal spirit is still inside each of us and has never died.

Notwithstanding, these aspirations that live within each of us can only be ascertained through deliberate action and grueling work. This means that unfortunately, most people fail to realize their dreams, and an extremely small percentage of the population can convincingly say they achieved what they dreamed of as a child. I, for one, am not a part of this group yet and still have many mountains to climb before I am remotely close.

The beautiful thing is that life is a journey, not a destination, which is an incredibly cliche thing to say, but is nevertheless true. Therefore, so long as one puts themself on a trajectory towards dream fulfillement, I believe that is sufficient to live happily, if we temporililty ignore family, realtionships and other important aspects of one's life without which one is doomed.

So in my personal case, I had these brilliant ideas of being the greatest man alive and accomplishing many things for all my teenage years and into adult life without any tangible action associated with it. This isn't to say I was miserable; I was consistently the smartest in my classes throught school, which I can only attribute to luck on the human IQ distrbiution, and I also was very atheltic: winning the ahtelete of the year award in ninth grade. Atheltics and scholarhship were two dominant forces in my schooling and I believe if I was more discniplined and hadn't spent time watching so much youtube, I could have gone even farther, but this is irrelevant.

Getting back on topic, in the fall of 2024 began my deliberate orchestration of a life that I happen to rather than a life that happens to me.
