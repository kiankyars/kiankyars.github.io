Here's the story of the beginning of how I avoided a mediocre life. I say beginning and not just that I'm no longer mediocre at all because I'm only just starting and I'm not cocky enough neither convicted to say that a life worth living is simply the result of a choice or some event. It is a sustained effort throughout one's entire life.

Throughout my entire life I've had aspirations and dreams of being somebody exceptional. I believe that every human that grows up in a loving environment and does not have ordinary constraints also possesses this mindset and is curious. This reminds me in fact of a thought exercise that the wise Nantte led us through at FR8, telling us to close our eyes and think about a time in our youth when we believed anything is possible and that there are no limits, and then subsequently saying us that this infernal spirit is still inside each of us and has never died.
