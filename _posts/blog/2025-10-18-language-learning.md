- It is now possible to learn languages for free with a experience as if you had a private tutor.

- It suffices to use the voice models offered either by OpenAI, DeepMind, or XAI, and to simply prompt it, depending on language skill.
    - I have a B1 level in German, so when I prompt the speech models, I either tell it to do a fictional B2 language test with me, where it tests for various Language skills which are incredible practice.
    - Otherwise, I will ask it to do a role play with me. For example, I role-played the following scenarioes:
        - Being a barista and helping a customer find a selection of coffee beans.
        - Going to the supermarket and asking a worker about the different health benefits of various fruits and vegetables.
        - You can make it as fun as you wish, i.e. saying ridiculous things like I heard donuts are healthier than fruits, and seeing the where the conversation goes.
