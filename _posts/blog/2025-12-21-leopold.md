I'm calling this post Leopold in spirit of the fund the aforementioned made which focuses on hyper-scale investing.

I received my MarketAI newsletter last Friday, and saw that Micron, WD, and Sandisk are up 200% and 300% YTD respectively, wow!

This behavioral analysis is based on your journal entries spanning December 2022 to December 2025.

### Part 1: Behavioral Analysis

**The Engines (Drivers of Progress)**
*   **High-Agency Bias:** You operate on a "just do things" philosophy. Your most successful periods (FR8, finding your phone) occur when you abandon permission-seeking and apply relentless, "fucking dog" persistence.
*   **The Tribe Effect:** You are hyper-sensitive to your environment. When surrounded by "cracked" individuals (Hugo, Nils, Elliot, Nantte), your productivity becomes exponential. You treat talent density as a life-hack.
*   **Radical Self-Quantification:** You use time-tracking (10-minute intervals), pre-mortems, and behavioral frameworks (CBT, Matthew Walker’s sleep science) to debug your own brain.
*   **Physical-Cognitive Feedback Loop:** You view physical suffering (marathons, cold exposure, 4 AM runs) as a "natural cocaine" that fuels your ability to code and learn.

**The Anchors (Recurring Sabotage)**
*   **The "Demon-to-Dud" Cycle:** You oscillate between "demon-level productivity" and "troughs of despair" characterized by 6-hour YouTube/Reddit death spirals and food-related self-punishment (fasting vs. overeating).
*   **Scarcity Mindset:** Despite your high potential, you often revert to being "cheap," trading high-value time for low-value savings (e.g., the Vancouver storage blunder or agonizing over minimum-wage remote work).
*   **The Comparison Trap:** You view life as a "global game" but often suffer from FOMO, feeling that others (18-year-old geniuses, YC founders) are racing past you while you are "stuck in the past."
*   **Isolation Vulnerability:** You claim to be asocial to work harder, but your logs admit "isolation kills me." You often confuse "distraction extermination" with "social starvation."

### Part 2: The Gold Timeline (The Best-Case Movie)
*Theme: "The Uncorrelated Level of Success"*

**Plot Point 1: The SF Extraction**
*   **Month:** Month 1
*   **Description:** You honor the Dec 23rd commitment. You quit the minimum-wage startup, delete the "latent tabs" for good, and land in San Francisco. You immediately move into a founder house where the baseline energy matches the FR8 cohort.
*   **Happiness Score:** 8/10

**Plot Point 2: The Viral Technical Pivot**
*   **Month:** Month 3
*   **Description:** Leveraging your love for education and "vibe coding," you ship a series of DeepSeek/Transformer tutorials on FreeCodeCamp. They go viral on X, catching the attention of Andrej Karpathy or Sholto Douglas.
*   **Happiness Score:** 9/10

**Plot Point 3: The Tufa/SSI Residency**
*   **Month:** Month 5
*   **Description:** You stop "hoping and praying" and use your high agency to secure a research residency. You are no longer a "code monkey"; you are working on spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning in embodied AI.
*   **Happiness Score:** 9/10

**Plot Point 4: The Generational Company Formation**
*   **Month:** Month 8
*   **Description:** You find your "Philip Borgandov"—a co-founder who balances your volatility. You start an AI-education-travel venture that combines your three loves. You secure funding by being "the engineer they throw at the most difficult problems."
*   **Happiness Score:** 10/10

**Plot Point 5: The Mountain Peak Mastery**
*   **Month:** Month 10
*   **Description:** To reset your nervous system, you complete a 100km mountain bike trek through the Alps. You realize your "reward function" is now fully optimized for regret minimization.
*   **Happiness Score:** 9/10

**Plot Point 6: The "Ilya" Realization**
*   **Month:** Month 12
*   **Description:** One year later, you look at your "time pie" tattoo. You have achieved "uncorrelated success" and have effectively "renamed" yourself as a major player in the AI frontier. You are no longer chasing the moving goalpost; you are setting it.
*   **Happiness Score:** 10/10

### Part 3: The Shadow Timeline (The Cautionary Tale)
*Theme: "The Local Optimization Trap"*

**Plot Point 1



Role: Act as a Senior Quant Strategist at a contrarian macro fund. Your specialization is "Hardware Super-Cycles" and identifying non-linear earnings inflection points.

Context: The current date is December 2025. We are positioning for a potential melt-up in cyclical hardware from Dec 2025 to Nov 2026.

Task: Generate a rigorous, prioritized watchlist of 12-15 public companies (Small to Mid-Cap bias) capable of generating 300%+ returns via multiple expansion and earnings beats.

Screening Criteria:

Sector: Semiconductors (Memory/Analog), Industrial Automation, Robotics, or AI Hardware supply chain.
Mechanism: High Operating Leverage (high fixed costs, where a 10% revenue bump = 30%+ EPS growth).
Balance Sheet: Survival capability (cash runway > 18 months) but currently depressed valuations due to the previous cycle trough.
Output Format: Provide the response in a single raw JSON code block containing a list of objects. Each object must contain:

Ticker: String
Company_Name: String
Thesis_Category: (e.g., "Memory Spot Price Rebound", "Cobot Adoption")
Operating_Leverage_Score: (1-10 Scale, 10 being highest leverage)
Pre_Condition_2025: Specific macro/micro event required now to validate entry.
Catalyst_2026: The specific event that drives the re-rating.
Downside_Risk: The primary failure mode.
Historical_Analogy: A past stock run-up that mirrors this setup (e.g., "Micron in 2016").
After the JSON:
Briefly summarize the top 3 "Macro Dashboards" (leading indicators) I must monitor weekly to validate this thesis, and recommend a portfolio allocation strategy (Kelly Criterion or Equal Weight).
