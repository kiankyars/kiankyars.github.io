I'm calling this post Leopold in spirit of the fund the aforementioned made which focuses on hyper-scale investing.

I received my [MarketSenseAI](https://marketsense-ai.com/blog/ai-automation-and-digital-infrastructure-cycle-2025-12-16?utm_source=email) newsletter last Friday, and saw that Micron, WD, and Sandisk are up 200% and 300% YTD respectively, wow!

ASML targets are as high as 1200 euros, and MU targets are $330!

This behavioral analysis is based on your journal entries spanning December 2022 to December 2025.

### Part 1: Behavioral Analysis

**The Engines (Drivers of Progress)**
*   **High-Agency Bias:** You operate on a "just do things" philosophy. Your most successful periods (FR8, finding your phone) occur when you abandon permission-seeking and apply relentless, "fucking dog" persistence.
*   **The Tribe Effect:** You are hyper-sensitive to your environment. When surrounded by "cracked" individuals (Hugo, Nils, Elliot, Nantte), your productivity becomes exponential. You treat talent density as a life-hack.
*   **Radical Self-Quantification:** You use time-tracking (10-minute intervals), pre-mortems, and behavioral frameworks (CBT, Matthew Walker’s sleep science) to debug your own brain.
*   **Physical-Cognitive Feedback Loop:** You view physical suffering (marathons, cold exposure, 4 AM runs) as a "natural cocaine" that fuels your ability to code and learn.

**The Anchors (Recurring Sabotage)**
*   **The "Demon-to-Dud" Cycle:** You oscillate between "demon-level productivity" and "troughs of despair" characterized by 6-hour YouTube/Reddit death spirals and food-related self-punishment (fasting vs. overeating).
*   **Scarcity Mindset:** Despite your high potential, you often revert to being "cheap," trading high-value time for low-value savings (e.g., the Vancouver storage blunder or agonizing over minimum-wage remote work).
*   **The Comparison Trap:** You view life as a "global game" but often suffer from FOMO, feeling that others (18-year-old geniuses, YC founders) are racing past you while you are "stuck in the past."
*   **Isolation Vulnerability:** You claim to be asocial to work harder, but your logs admit "isolation kills me." You often confuse "distraction extermination" with "social starvation."

### Part 2: The Gold Timeline (The Best-Case Movie)
*Theme: "The Uncorrelated Level of Success"*

**Plot Point 1: The SF Extraction**
*   **Month:** Month 1
*   **Description:** You honor the Dec 23rd commitment. You quit the minimum-wage startup, delete the "latent tabs" for good, and land in San Francisco. You immediately move into a founder house where the baseline energy matches the FR8 cohort.
*   **Happiness Score:** 8/10

**Plot Point 2: The Viral Technical Pivot**
*   **Month:** Month 3
*   **Description:** Leveraging your love for education and "vibe coding," you ship a series of DeepSeek/Transformer tutorials on FreeCodeCamp. They go viral on X, catching the attention of Andrej Karpathy or Sholto Douglas.
*   **Happiness Score:** 9/10

**Plot Point 3: The Tufa/SSI Residency**
*   **Month:** Month 5
*   **Description:** You stop "hoping and praying" and use your high agency to secure a research residency. You are no longer a "code monkey"; you are working on spatial reasoning and long-horizon planning in embodied AI.
*   **Happiness Score:** 9/10

**Plot Point 4: The Generational Company Formation**
*   **Month:** Month 8
*   **Description:** You find your "Philip Borgandov"—a co-founder who balances your volatility. You start an AI-education-travel venture that combines your three loves. You secure funding by being "the engineer they throw at the most difficult problems."
*   **Happiness Score:** 10/10

**Plot Point 5: The Mountain Peak Mastery**
*   **Month:** Month 10
*   **Description:** To reset your nervous system, you complete a 100km mountain bike trek through the Alps. You realize your "reward function" is now fully optimized for regret minimization.
*   **Happiness Score:** 9/10

**Plot Point 6: The "Ilya" Realization**
*   **Month:** Month 12
*   **Description:** One year later, you look at your "time pie" tattoo. You have achieved "uncorrelated success" and have effectively "renamed" yourself as a major player in the AI frontier. You are no longer chasing the moving goalpost; you are setting it.
*   **Happiness Score:** 10/10

### Part 3: The Shadow Timeline (The Cautionary Tale)
*Theme: "The Local Optimization Trap"*

**Plot Point 1



Role: Act as a Senior Quant Strategist at a contrarian macro fund. Your specialization is "Hardware Super-Cycles" and identifying non-linear earnings inflection points.

Context: The current date is December 2025. We are positioning for a potential melt-up in cyclical hardware from Dec 2025 to Nov 2026.

Task: Generate a rigorous, prioritized watchlist of 12-15 public companies (Small to Mid-Cap bias) capable of generating 300%+ returns via multiple expansion and earnings beats.

Screening Criteria:

Sector: Semiconductors (Memory/Analog), Industrial Automation, Robotics, or AI Hardware supply chain.
Mechanism: High Operating Leverage (high fixed costs, where a 10% revenue bump = 30%+ EPS growth).
Balance Sheet: Survival capability (cash runway > 18 months) but currently depressed valuations due to the previous cycle trough.
Output Format: Provide the response in a single raw JSON code block containing a list of objects. Each object must contain:

Ticker: String
Company_Name: String
Thesis_Category: (e.g., "Memory Spot Price Rebound", "Cobot Adoption")
Operating_Leverage_Score: (1-10 Scale, 10 being highest leverage)
Pre_Condition_2025: Specific macro/micro event required now to validate entry.
Catalyst_2026: The specific event that drives the re-rating.
Downside_Risk: The primary failure mode.
Historical_Analogy: A past stock run-up that mirrors this setup (e.g., "Micron in 2016").
After the JSON:
Briefly summarize the top 3 "Macro Dashboards" (leading indicators) I must monitor weekly to validate this thesis, and recommend a portfolio allocation strategy (Kelly Criterion or Equal Weight).

The highest agency thing you can do is to stop treating the JSON as a "result" and start treating it as source code for an automated truth-seeking machine.

Do not just read the list. Build a Python-based "Living Thesis" Pipeline.

Here is the step-by-step execution plan to convert that static JSON into a dynamic edge:

1. The "Truth Filter" (Programmatic Validation)
LLMs hallucinate financial data. The highest agency move is to assume the logic is sound but the numbers are fake until proven real.

Action: Write a Python script (using pandas and yfinance or Financial Modeling Prep API).
Logic:
Ingest the JSON.
Fetch the last 3 years of income statements for every Ticker.
Calculate the actual Operating Leverage: Compute (% Change in EBIT) / (% Change in Revenue).
The Filter: If the calculated leverage is < 2.0 (or whatever your threshold is), auto-delete the entry from the JSON.
Result: You now have a sanitized list of companies that mathematically fit the thesis, stripping out the AI hallucinations.
2. The "Sentiment Scout" (LLM Agent Loop)
The JSON includes specific text fields like Pre_Condition_2025 and Catalyst_2026. These are semantic triggers.

Action: specific set up a daily cron job (using a lightweight framework like LangChain or just OpenAI API).
Logic:
Every morning, scrape news/earnings call transcripts for the surviving tickers.
Vector Comparison: Compare the day's news against the Catalyst_2026 text description in your JSON.
Scoring: Have the AI output a "Validation Score" (0-100). Is the catalyst happening?
Result: A dashboard that lights up green only when the narrative matches the reality.
3. The "Relative Strength" Heatmap
You asked to visualize it. Don't just visualize price. Visualize the divergence.

Action: Build a Streamlit dashboard.
Logic:
Plot the stock price of the tickers against the price of the underlying commodity (e.g., DRAM spot prices, Copper, Robotics ETF).
The Signal: Highlight instances where the commodity is ripping (The "Super-Cycle" part) but the stock hasn't moved yet.
Result: This identifies the specific "coiled spring" entry points mentioned in the thesis.
Summary of the "High Agency" Workflow:
You are not picking stocks. You are building a surveillance system.

JSON Generation (The Idea)
API Validation (The Reality Check)
Semantic Monitoring (The Timing)
Why this is High Agency:
Most people will ask ChatGPT for stock picks and buy them. You are using ChatGPT to architect a logic structure, then using hard code to verify it, creating a proprietary tool that works while you sleep.

This is the "Wall Street" answer rather than the "Silicon Valley" answer.

If you don't want to code a tool, you shouldn't. The highest agency move is to leverage existing institutional infrastructure to do the work for you, and use the JSON purely for trade structuring.

Here is the Zero-Code, High-Agency workflow:

1. The "Adversarial Audit" (5 Minutes)
Don't trust the JSON. Make a smarter AI check the hallucinating AI.

Action: Copy the JSON list produced by the first model.
Prompt into Perplexity (or ChatGPT with Search): "I am vetting these tickers. Based on the Q3 2025 earnings reports and latest 10-Qs, verify two things for every company on this list: 1) Do they have at least 18 months of cash runway? 2) Is their operating margin currently depressed below their 5-year average? Eliminate any that fail."
Result: You get a curated list based on actual recent filings, without writing a single line of python.
2. The "Visual Dashboard" (TradingView Import)
You don't need to build a visualization app; TradingView already exists and it's better than anything you can code.

Action: Take the surviving tickers from step 1. Format them as a comma-separated list (e.g., NVDA, MU, ACLS).
Workflow:
Open TradingView.
Create a new Watchlist named "2026 Inflection".
Paste the list.
The "Agency" Move: Switch the chart comparison to "Relative Strength" (Divide the ticker by the sector ETF, e.g., MU / SOXX).
Why: You can instantly see which stocks are showing "hidden strength" (rising faster than their sector) before the price explodes.
3. The "Asymmetric Bet" (Jan 2027 LEAPS)
Buying stock and holding is low agency if you are targeting 300% returns in 12 months. You need leverage, but margin is dangerous. The solution is LEAPS (Long-Term Equity Anticipation Securities).

The Logic: The prompt targets a move from "Dec 2025 to Nov 2026."
The Trade: Instead of buying shares, you buy Deep Out-of-the-Money Call Options expiring in January 2027.
The Setup:
Look at the Catalyst_2026 price target in the JSON.
Buy calls with a strike price roughly 20-30% above the current price (since you expect a melt-up).
Why this is high agency:
Capped Risk: You can only lose the premium paid (no margin calls).
No "Vibe Coding": You place the trade once. You don't manage a bot.
Theta Protection: Buying Jan 2027 calls gives you over a year for the thesis to play out without time decay killing you immediately.
Summary
Audit with Perplexity (removes the hallucinations).
Watch on TradingView (removes the need for a custom app).
Execute via a Basket of Jan 2027 LEAPS (removes the need for active trading while maximizing return).
