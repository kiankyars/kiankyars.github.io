I have quite a few learnings from [FR8](fr8.so) that I want to be more intentional about, and I wanted to put my thoughts down here on simple ways to embody them.

- how to extract most from positive experiences (FR8 itself)
  - stay in touch with positive, ambitious people
- how to avoid being mediocre when surrounded by it (once I left FR8)
  - maintain strict routine
- how to be more disagreeable (one of the three characteristics of high agency along with clear thinking and action bias.)
  - don't ask for permission
- how to be more confrontational (So as to not let oneself get thrown around)
  - take the viewpoint of "I'm not afraid to say harsh things if it is still to the benefit of the person you're telling it to, to the best of your knowledge
  - praise in public and criticize in private
