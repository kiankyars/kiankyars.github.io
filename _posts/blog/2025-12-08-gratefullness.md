I recently made a tweet:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Very fewer people (if any) practice gratitude in excess, than in scarcity</p>&mdash; Kian Kyars (@neuralkian) <a href="https://twitter.com/neuralkian/status/1997275853689151814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

This was inspired by the fact that I have started saying what I am grateful for out-loud before every meal I eat. What had hitherto been a practice I associated purely with religion is now something I hope to continue to cultivate despite being a non-believer. I recall, for example, being invited to have dinner at a professor's house in Fall 2024, and he said grace before the meal, and I thought it very genuine and meaningful, but that was all.

I have always written what I'm grateful for every day, which is a great practice in my opinion. However, I think that this is even cooler because you have something that you're grateful for on a plate in front of you while you're saying the words, and it really feels good after you do it to eat your meal.

All that to say: I recommend you do the same thing before every meal.
