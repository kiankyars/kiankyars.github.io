This is my first blog book review.

Dune is very out of distribution when compared to other science fiction novels in terms of character, plot, writing style, etc. which meant I didn’t understand many things.

I've never read a book where, even halfway through I was still really unclear of the dynamics, groups (like the Bene Gesserit) and characters, but it was still compelling.

It's unique how Frank integrates words and concepts from many different cultures. For example, there's many words that are Iranian such as padishah emperor, German words are also present.

I recommend this book as it seems to me an anti-memetic force.
