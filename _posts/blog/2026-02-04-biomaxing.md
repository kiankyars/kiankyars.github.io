I intend on running rigorous self-experiments on my health through biohacking and supplements. This blog post will capture my experiments and running logs.

  - Up to now I finished the zinc tablets and I did not become sick. So that's awesome. And in fact, at a certain point due to lack of sleep I thought I was at risk of becoming sick, so maybe the zinc helped prevent.
  - Since this morning I've started taking the magnesium ashwagandha tablets; they supplement for muscle, bone, heart, and relaxation according to the label. So until I run out of them, I will observe if there's any correlated effects.
