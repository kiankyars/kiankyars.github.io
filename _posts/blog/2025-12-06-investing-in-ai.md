I've been trying to increase my exposure to investments which will appreciate with overall positive AI sentiment and progress, and here are my thoughts:

Currently my portfolio is composed of perhaps 80-90% equity in companies like Nvidia, Google, Meta, Microsoft, etc., which are directly involved in developing Frontier AI, the rest being in US and International ETFs.

However, I feel like I'm still missing out on latent opportunities and I'm considering what the next play is now that these companies are all getting heavily invested into and what the downstream effects will be.

Despite the above sentence, I grokked all of the basic option principles today because my intent now is to buy specifically alphabet calls. For example, today I was looking at the March 2026 expiry date calls at a $350 strike price, which would require approximately a 13-14% increase in share price to break even, which is a $4.22 trillion valuation from the current $3.88 trillion valuation. Once again, though, I need to remind myself that if I did buy this contract, there's somebody selling it who thinks that the price is not going to reach that strike price. And although I can naively think that I have more information than them because I'm at the edge of progress and understand the advances more than most, the future is unpredictable.

Otherwise, I'm interested in latent industries and sectors which will implicitly receive AI investment, with the classical examples being modular nuclear reactor developers, fiber optic companies, which connect the data centers, as well as semiconductor manufacturers.

I'm trying to tune my thinking by projecting myself five months ahead and thinking for what missed opportunity I will tell myself, "wow, why didn't I invest in that in December 2025?" However, this is of course an exercise which is much easier in hindsight than in the moment.

With that being said, I conclude that for now I'm going to focus on cloud providers and big tech because it's the most direct bet on AI. And to be honest, unless something happens to Taiwan, I'm really bullish on continued bubble-esque investment; nevertheless, I am very much candid in saying I know nothing about investing and that PhD investors might eat me up, which has already happened in the past, by the way. This is why I only invest money I can lose. Since losing money still isn't fun, I should perhaps be risk-averse with respect to options, even though I feel there's much to be had. Notwithstanding, my risk-aversion level is most people's highest risk level, so I should already be contented by that.
