I have been in SF since January 13th; here are my observations:

1. The statement that everybody in the tech/startup scene in SF is kind and helps each other is true, a few anecdotal examples:
   - I'm writing this at the Frontier Tower (co-working space), because my friend Sree who I met on a hike invited me as a guest; he is in turn talking with somebody I intro'd him to in the next room.
     - <div style="display: flex; gap: 10px; flex-wrap: wrap;">
       <img src="/imgs/2026-01-19-sf/ft1.jpg" width="300"/>
       <img src="/imgs/2026-01-19-sf/ft2.jpg" width="300"/>
       </div>

   - On numerous occasions while having lunch or dinner with others, I've been asked about my interests and then subsequently if I'd like an intro to a given person because we might be aligned.

   - I got coffee with a few founders at Blue Bottle and they insisted and then paid for my espresso.

   - Overall everybody is very inclusive and welcoming, you get what you give.

2. Chutzpah is rewarded here strongly. What I mean is if you're audacious, then instead of being thought of as forward, you'll be rewarded.

3. It is quite transactional; even though I have been avoiding talking about the person's startup instead of themself in some conversations, it occurs that somebody starts pitching you unsolicited.

4. The bonafide optimism you experience here. When I was co-working at an office last Saturday, they were earnestly talking about longevity and cryogenics e.g. which cryo lab they will recommend to their relatives. This was eye-opening because I had only interacted with these concepts before "in theory".

5. The network effects here are insane, and I've met many people so far who I've had mutuals with unbeknownst to me.

6. As I was told by Teddy from Founders Embassy, discernment is key; there is a massive offering of events, meetups, etc., but discernment is knowing what's worth it and what isn't.

Sam asked me last night at midnight in the Mission Dolores park what I have learnt so far while in SF, spurring me to write this.

It is Feb 11, 2026 at 20:39 and it has now been four weeks, here are the new insights I have since gained:

7. The highs are insane (I've only had one low so far).

8. You casually meet people that have changed the world.

9. You _truly_ develop the belief that the laws of physics are the only limit.

10. You can meet anyone you want.

11. Most people are very low-ego.

12. It is serendipitous e.g. I won a hackathon which led to an accelerator offer.
