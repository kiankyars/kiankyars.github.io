Victory #1:
- Superlative sauna session on tuesday evening with Elliot, Daryna, and Rohan.
   
Victory #2:
- Grokked python packaging in two days, I'm a pypi wizard now.
   
Victory #3:
- Submitted the THIRD revision of my article for the [Columbia Math Journal](https://journals.library.columbia.edu/index.php/cjum/index), I have been exploited and will never submit to an undergraduate journal again (good thing I can't anyway since I'm done school), but at least I'll have a fire journal publication come August ðŸ˜ˆ.
- Took all of wednesday to do, not counting the days of stress from the previous revisions in March and April.

Bonus:
- 10pm Bunker rave on wednesday was lit, instant dopamine after submitting the journal from #3.
