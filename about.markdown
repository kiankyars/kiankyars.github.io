This is the about page. Add your content here.

I am mostly interested in machine learning and software engineering. Lately, a lot of my focus has been on Large Language Models - both in using them as a tool when combined with formal methods, and in understanding and interpreting them.

I am currently open to job opportunities. If you found my work interesting and think I could be a good fit for your team, feel free to reach out via [email](mailto:kkyars@ualberta.ca) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyars/).

Outside of work, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/kyars) and creating [technical content](https://www.youtube.com/@neuralkian).
