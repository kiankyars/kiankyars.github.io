- After trying, unsuccessfully, to make version two of my personal website via a large jump in framework (Gatsby), I will be putting my personal website on pause until I learn sufficient React to make my own simple page for the second edition. The main focus this time will be on making the website more appealing than the first.

- In the mean time, check out my [medium](https://medium.com/@kyars), where I post the blog that was intended to go on this page.
