My first website, it is a resume-style website using Bootstrap 5.

Future plans:

Figure out how to make website more mobile friendly via either the
<meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1 width=device-width"> tag
or using breakpoints, containers, rows, and columns via Boostrap.

Resize the Carousel to take up less space.

Add a dark mode toggle.
