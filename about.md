I am passionate about 3 things.

- education
- running
- natural languages

I agree with the opinion expressed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vDOmF-fPfBHG1hM2DsS6gHd04XYETcmtq-0kPsaDVO8), [this](https://paulgraham.com/selfindulgence.html) is my favourite PG article, and I recommend young people read Patrick Collison's [advice](https://patrickcollison.com/advice).

I identify as follows (I have not thought enough about the order yet to rank them by importance):

- Canadian
- Runner
- Human
- Unreasonable optimist
- Learner
- Teacher
- Hard-worker

I heavily prefer asymmetric longtail outcomes over guaranteed ones.

I used to do weekly review but they were ineffective so I stopped.

I optimize for elegance

You will not find the word "try" anywhere on this website except for here.

> People I know who spend a lot of time revisiting old decisions are less effective because they mire themselves in what ifs and counterfactuals. So I really don't spend time on it.
