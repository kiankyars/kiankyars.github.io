I am mostly interested in machine learning and software engineering. Lately, a lot of my focus has been on Large Language Models.

Outside of work, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/kyars), creating [technical content](https://www.youtube.com/@neuralkian), and going into Wikipedia rabbit holes.
