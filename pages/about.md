I am passionate about 4 things.

- education
- running
- natural languages
- travelling

I teach [technical content](https://www.youtube.com/@neuralkian), and contribute to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Kyars).

I agree with the opinon expressed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vDOmF-fPfBHG1hM2DsS6gHd04XYETcmtq-0kPsaDVO8), and I recommend young people to read [this](https://patrickcollison.com/advice).

I identify as follows (I have not thought enough about the order yet to rank them by importance):

- Canadian
- Runner
- Human
- Optimist
- Learner
- Teacher
- Hard-worker
