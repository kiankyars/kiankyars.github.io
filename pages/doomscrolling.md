Here I track how many times per month I doomscroll as a heuristic for my life well-being and productivity

# 2025

## September

#### 1

## October

#### 3 (youtube doomscrolling, number two and three are due to my sudden obsession with competitive food eaters (beardmeatsfood))

## November

#### 3 (I lacked three times in the last week of the month, smh!)

## December

#### 0 (so proud of myself, this is how you bring momentum into the new year!)

# 2026

## January

#### 0 so far
