Here I track how many times per month I doomscroll as a heuristic for my life well-being and productivity

## 2025

- September  
  - 1
- October  
  - 3 (Youtube doomscrolling, number two and three are due to my sudden obsession with competitive food eater beardmeatsfood!)
- November  
  - 3 (I lacked three times in the last week of the month, smh!)
- December  
  - 0 (So proud of myself, this is how you bring momentum into the new year!)

## 2026
